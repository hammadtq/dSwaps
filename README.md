# dSwaps

dSwaps is a static dapp suitable for hosting on IPFS. The dapp does not use any kind of server and communicates directly with ethereum blockchain. 

To start using the app, download or clone it on your computer. Run an IPFS daemon, then add dSwaps folder to the IPFS using 
```ipfs add -r dSwaps``` command. Note the main folder hash that the terminal will provide, open it in your bowser to start using the dapp. 

The dapp requires a modern browser with MetaMask extension to work!

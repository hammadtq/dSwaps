# Testing dSwaps

Testing dSwaps involves running tests through [Selenium IDE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selenium-ide/mooikfkahbdckldjjndioackbalphokd?hl=en) browser extension in the chrome or FireFox browser.

Before running the tests, makes sure:
- You have MetaMask installed
- Ropsten is selected as the network
- You have enough ETH, KNC and ZIL tokens in the MetaMask to run the tests (tests take about 2 tokens each)

After installing the extension, open dSwaps.side in the extension and run individual tests.

Orderbook tests are performed against ZIL orderbook.
